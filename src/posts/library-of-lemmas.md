## Power of a point lemma

### Definition
We define the power of a point $X$ which lies on the line segment $AB$ to be $AX\cdot XB$. This is equivalent to $OX^2-r^2$, where $O$ is the center of the circle.

### Theorem (Raw elementary)
The power of a point theorem just says that if two line segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersect at point $X$, and if $AX\cdot XB=CX\cdot XD$, then $ABCD$ is concyclic.

## Haruki's Lemma

## Orders modulo a prime

### Definition (Orders modulo a prime)
**The order of a number modulo prime** is the least positive integer $n$ such that $a^n \equiv 1\pmod{p}$.

### Lemma (Result of negative residues.)
Let $n^2\equiv -1\pmod{p}$ for some odd primes, then $p\equiv -1\pmod{4}$.

*Proof:*
$n^2\equiv -1 \pmod{p}\Longrightarrow n^4\equiv 1\pmod{p}$ which means that 4 is an order modulo $p$. According to the fundamental principle of Orders, $4|p-1$.

## The butterfly of the garden

### Lemma (The butterfly lemma)
For a cyclic quadrilateral $ABCD$ with circumcircle $\omega$ let the diagonals of the quadrilateral $AC$ and $BD$ meet at $M$. Let there be another chord $EF$ such that the midpoint of the chord is $M$. Then the midpoint of $XY$ is also $M$.
